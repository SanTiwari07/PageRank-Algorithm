Features:
Input Web Structure: Users input the total number of webpages and their directed links (edges) in the web graph.
Matrix Representation: The program uses two matrices to represent the web structure and the transition probabilities.
PageRank Calculation: After initializing the matrix, it calculates the PageRank of each webpage using the power iteration method.
Iteration Control: Users can specify the number of iterations for which the PageRank algorithm will run.
Rank Output: Finally, the program outputs the ranks of the webpages after the specified iterations.



How to Use:
Enter the total number of webpages.
Enter links between the webpages in the format r c where r links to c. Enter 0 0 to stop.
The program calculates the PageRank values after the specified number of iterations.
View the final ranks for each webpage.
